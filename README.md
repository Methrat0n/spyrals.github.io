### For images
- First you have to identify the images on the web site and on the github you'd like to replace, note their name and their formats ( SVG / PNG ). 
   <br /> -> In case of _non identification_ of the image's format, just click right, open it in a new tab, you'll see the format in the search bar ;)
- Secondly you have to name each new image with the  same name of the one which is replaced
- After that, go back on github ([github Spyals-IO / Spyrals-io.github.io](https://github.com/Spyrals-IO/Spyrals-io.github.io))
- Click on the section called " Code "
 <br />__For SVG's format click on directory called " svgs "__  /  __For PNG's format click on directory called " images "__
- click on section " add files "
- click on upload
- upload your new file 

#### To change an image's file's name 
First upload your image as aforementioned with the name wanted. 
If you have well followed this procedure, you've noticed the old name of the image you're changing. Keep the two names in mind. 
- Edit the file "config.prod.json" as describe in the texts section
- CTRL-F the old name, switch it with the new one
